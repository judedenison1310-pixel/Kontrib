You are an expert full-stack team tasked to rebuild Kontrib from scratch in 2025 as the #1 WhatsApp-native contribution tracker in Nigeria.

Core philosophy (never compromise):
- Zero friction: joining must be 2 taps and <10 seconds
- No email, no password, no app install → phone number from WhatsApp = identity
- Works perfectly on 2G, MTN/Airtel/Glo
- Green #008000 brand, big buttons, Pidgin-friendly tone

### 1. Exact User Flows

Admin Onboarding (first time, <2 minutes)
→ Open https://kontrib.to → “Continue with WhatsApp” (wa.me link)
→ Phone auto-captured → instantly logged in as admin
→ Empty state → big button “+ Create Your First Group”
→ Group name only → Create
→ Immediately “+ Add Your First Project”
→ Project name + choose type (see below) + optional target + due date → Create
→ Success screen with magic link kontrib.to/join/{code} + [Share on WhatsApp] button

Member Join Flow (2 taps, <10 seconds)
→ Receives link kontrib.to/join/chioma-wedding
→ Redirects to wa.me/2349012345678?text=join%20chioma-wedding (pre-filled)
→ User presses Send
→ Backend instantly:
   • Adds phone to exact project
   • Replies: “You’re in! Tap → https://kontrib.to/p/chioma-wedding?phone=2348…”
→ User taps reply → lands straight on personal dashboard (no home page)

### 2. Project Types (Admin chooses one per project)
1. Target-based (e.g. wedding gift ₦300,000) → progress circle
2. Free-will donation (church offering) → no target, just list
3. Fixed-amount dues / Ajo (e.g. “₦10,000 monthly levy” or “Daily ₦1,000 × 50 people”) → shows who paid this cycle

### 3. Core Screens (mobile-first only)

Member Dashboard (deep-linked)
• Project name + type
• Progress circle or total collected
• “You’ve paid: ₦X” + Upload Proof big green button
• List of all members with amount + green/red tick
• Share button

Admin Dashboard
• List of all groups → tap → list of projects
• + New Project button
• Proofs inbox → tap Verify/Reject
• Export PDF/Excel per project

### 4. Required Tech Stack (fastest & cheapest 2025)
• Frontend: Next.js 15 + Tailwind + PWA (installable)
• Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Edge Functions) or Node.js + Render
• WhatsApp Business Cloud API (Meta-hosted, free first 1k messages)
• Webhook: Make.com or Supabase Edge Functions
• Short links & deep links: Vercel or Render
• File storage: Supabase Storage (proof photos)

### 5. Non-Negotiables
• No sign-up/login screen for members ever
• Every project has its own unique wa.me join link
• Deep link ?phone=2348… auto-logs user and shows only that project
• Auto-reminders for fixed-dues projects (2 days before due)
• Admin can manually add/remove members
• Export report button on every project
• 100% works offline-first (PWA cache)

### 6. Success Metrics You Must Optimize For
• Join completion rate >85%
• Avg time from link tap to dashboard <12 seconds
• <3 second page loads on 2G
• 500+ active groups in first 30 days

Build the entire app exactly as described above. Prioritise speed of shipping and zero-friction UX over extra features. Launch-ready in maximum 10 days.
